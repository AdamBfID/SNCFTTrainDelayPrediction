### 2. Feature Engineering
```python
# Advanced features created:
- Station sequence features (station_order, station_progress)
- Lag features (prev_arrival_delay, prev_departure_delay)
- Rolling averages (rolling_avg_arrival_delay)
- Station statistics (station_avg_arrival_delay, station_std_arrival_delay)
- Train statistics (train_avg_arrival_delay, train_std_arrival_delay)
- Time-based features (is_rush_hour, time_of_day)
```

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest** (Best Performance): 98.94% accuracy
- **Gradient Boosting**: 96.78% accuracy
- **Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression**: 93.38% accuracy

### 4. Model Performance
```
